# SotATrainer
SotA Trainer is a utility that provides combat statistics for players of Shroud of the Avatar.

To use the utility, simply unzip the file to any folder location you prefer, and run the utility
while running the Shroud of the Avatar game client.

You can drag the utility to any location in the visible game screen, it will remain visible
while playing the game.  The utility will continue to monitor your game client's log file and
parse relevant data that can be used to provide the statistical information the utility provides.

Currently, the utility has been tested on Microsoft Windows 10 computers, but should also run on
Microsoft Windows 7.

A version for MacBook and Linux will be available in the future.
